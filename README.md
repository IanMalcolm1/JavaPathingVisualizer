# JavaPathingVisualizer
A little program meant to allow people to write their own pathing algorithms and see them work.

Made this over the course of a few days in the hopes of teaching people some pathing/graph traversal algorithms. It didn't go through, but I think its kinda fun, if a bit jank. If you want to use it look at the Main.java file for an example of breadth-first search.

There's some extraneous saving functionality (NodeManager.makeSnapshot() and NodeManager.saveNodes()). Just ignore it, I decided not to go through with it (80/20 rule and all that).
